üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML: Structuring the web application content.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid and responsive styling, ensuring a modern and clean UI.

JavaScript: Powering all dynamic interactions, form handling, and API communication.

html2pdf.js: A client-side library for converting HTML content directly into downloadable PDF documents.

AI Integration:

Gemini API: The core AI model providing intelligent content suggestions for summaries and bullet points.

Backend (Conceptual for API Security):

A secure backend endpoint (e.g., Node.js with Express, Python with Flask, or a serverless function) is conceptually used to securely handle the Gemini API key and proxy requests from the frontend to the Gemini API. This prevents exposing the API key in client-side code.
